# Transfer_Learning_and_Fine_Tuning

In this notebook, similarly to what you can find at this URL (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning), you can find an implemented and working algorithm for transfer learning and fine tuning, put together with a for loop that will iterate on many pre-trained model. The history of each model is plotted, and the confusion matrix can be visualized.

The model was implemented unsing Tensorflow-Keras, in November 2021.

The model was developed in VS_Code, using a GPU Nvidia.

You need to download your own dataset and change the "path" at the beginning of this notebook to make it work. If you don't know which dataset to use, download it from here (https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset).
